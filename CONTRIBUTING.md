## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `exploitdb` for local development.

* Fork the `exploitdb` repo on GitHub.
* Clone your fork locally:

```
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/exploitdb.git
```

* Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

```
    $ mkvirtualenv exploitdb
    $ cd exploitdb/
    $ python setup.py develop
```

* Create a branch for local development::

```
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

* Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

* Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
